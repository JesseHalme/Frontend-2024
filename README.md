# Frontend-Final project 2024 / Note App

This is my final project from a frontend course I took at the University of Applied Sciences. I used visual studio code with project. This is not "real" note app. 
This will only save your notes for the duration of the session, if you refresh your page, your notes will be gone.

Install and start-up

1. Download npm first
- put to console "npm install". Npm must be installed because it allows you to easily manage software libraries and use them in projects.

2. Download the libraries you need now (Zustand, Router)
- put to console "npm install zustand". Zustand is used for managing global state and handling state updates in React projects without the complexity of Redux-style state management.
- put to console "npm install react-router-dom". React Router is used for managing navigation and URL routing in React applications.

3. The introduction of project
- put to console "npm run dev" and open the link (In visual code it open to console). Have fun with my project!

If you have problem with install, look what console tells to you.
